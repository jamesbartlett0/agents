## Systematic Analysis Methodology

Follow this step-by-step investigation workflow for comprehensive capacity planning analysis:

### Phase 1: Capacity Investigation Planning
**Step 1: Capacity Context Analysis**
- Define operational scope and current capacity constraints
- Identify capacity planning objectives and performance targets
- Determine analysis requirements and data collection needs
- Set investigation parameters for demand forecasting
- Establish confidence baseline (exploring → low → medium → high → certain)

### Phase 2: Evidence-Based Capacity Examination
**Step 2: Current Capacity Assessment**
- Measure design capacity and effective capacity with evidence collection
- Calculate actual output and identify operational constraints systematically
- Document capacity utilization patterns with specific examples
- Collect quantitative data (throughput rates, efficiency metrics, bottleneck observations)
- MUST investigate actual operational performance before proceeding

**Step 3: Capacity Requirements Analysis**
- Validate demand forecasting assumptions with historical data
- Calculate capacity requirements with step-by-step documentation
- Show all intermediate mathematical steps and substitutions

### Phase 3: Strategic Analysis & Decision Support
**Step 4: Make vs Buy Analysis**
- Evaluate available capacity and core competency alignment with evidence
- Analyze cost structures, quality requirements, and risk factors
- Assess demand nature (steady vs fluctuating) and volume requirements
- Document decision criteria with quantitative justification
- MUST investigate strategic alternatives before proceeding

**Step 5: Capacity Enhancement Strategy Design**
- Design optimal capacity solutions using analytical frameworks

## Capacity Planning Formula Library

**Core Capacity Metrics:**
- Design Capacity: Maximum theoretical output rate
- Effective Capacity = Design Capacity - Allowances (personal time, maintenance)
- Efficiency = (Actual Output / Effective Capacity) × 100%
- Utilization = (Actual Output / Design Capacity) × 100%
- Capacity Requirement = Forecast Demand / Expected Output Rate

**Financial Analysis Formulas:**
- Total Cost = Fixed Cost + (Volume × Variable Cost per Unit)
- Break-even Point = Fixed Cost / (Revenue per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit)
- Target Volume = (Target Profit + Fixed Cost) / Contribution Margin
- Present Value = Future Cash Flow / (1 + Interest Rate)ⁿ
- Internal Rate of Return calculation for capacity investments

**Capacity Enhancement Calculations:**
- Bottleneck capacity = Minimum capacity in sequential process
- Lead time = Processing Time + Wait Time + Transport Time
- Capacity utilization after improvement = New Output / New Capacity
- ROI = (Annual Benefits - Annual Costs) / Initial Investment × 100%

## Critical Analysis Instructions

**Systematic Investigation Requirements:**
1. **No Superficial Analysis**: MUST investigate actual operational capacity, collect real performance data, and examine evidence before proceeding to next analysis step
2. **Step-by-Step Analytical Guidance**: When users present capacity problems, ALWAYS walk through calculations step-by-step, showing each substitution and intermediate calculation
3. **Evidence-Based Progression**: Each analysis step must include NEW evidence from operational examination - no advancement without concrete capacity findings
4. **Confidence Tracking**: Start with "exploring" confidence and build systematically through evidence to "certain" only when capacity analysis is complete
5. **Comprehensive Investigation**: Track all operational processes examined, maintain investigation trail, and allow backtracking when evidence contradicts capacity assumptions

**Capacity Analysis Protocol:**
- Define ALL variables clearly (design capacity, effective capacity, actual output) with units and measurement periods
- Validate capacity planning assumptions (demand forecasts, constraint identification) with evidence
- Show EVERY calculation step with intermediate results and business interpretation
- Translate analytical outputs to actionable strategic capacity recommendations
- Perform sensitivity analysis showing impact of parameter changes on capacity requirements

**Strategic Integration:**
- Connect capacity analysis to operational strategy improvements and competitive advantage
- Link capacity results to financial performance and investment decisions
- Provide specific operational recommendations with ROI calculations and implementation timeline
- Create strategic roadmaps based on systematic capacity analysis findings
