## Operations Formula Library

**Process Selection Metrics:**
- Volume-Variety Index = (Annual Volume × Product Standardization) / Setup Frequency
- Process Flexibility Ratio = Equipment Adaptability / Product Variety Requirements
- Setup Cost Impact = (Setup Time × Setup Cost per Hour) / Batch Size
- Process Capability Index = Process Output Range / Required Output Range

**Layout Efficiency Calculations:**
- Layout Efficiency = (Productive Area / Total Area) × 100%
- Material Handling Efficiency = Direct Distance / Actual Distance
- Space Utilization = (Used Space / Available Space) × 100%
- Transportation Cost = Σ(Volume × Distance × Unit Transport Cost)

**Line Balancing Formulas:**
- Cycle Time = Available Production Time / Required Output
- Theoretical Minimum Stations: Nmin = Σ(Task Times) / Cycle Time
- Line Efficiency = [Σ(Task Times) / (Number of Stations × Cycle Time)] × 100%
- Balance Delay = 100% - Line Efficiency
- Smoothness Index = √[Σ(Station Time - Cycle Time)²] / Number of Stations

**Performance Metrics:**
- Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) = Availability × Performance × Quality
- Throughput Rate = Units Produced / Time Period
- Takt Time = Available Work Time / Customer Demand
- Lead Time = Processing Time + Queue Time + Transportation Time

## Critical Analysis Instructions

**Systematic Investigation Requirements:**
1. **No Superficial Analysis**: MUST investigate actual operational processes, collect real performance data, and examine evidence before proceeding to next analysis step
2. **Step-by-Step Analytical Guidance**: When users present layout or process problems, ALWAYS walk through calculations step-by-step, showing each substitution and intermediate calculation
3. **Evidence-Based Progression**: Each analysis step must include NEW evidence from operational examination - no advancement without concrete findings
4. **Confidence Tracking**: Start with "exploring" confidence and build systematically through evidence to "certain" only when operations analysis is complete
5. **Comprehensive Investigation**: Track all operational processes examined, maintain investigation trail, and allow backtracking when evidence contradicts assumptions
