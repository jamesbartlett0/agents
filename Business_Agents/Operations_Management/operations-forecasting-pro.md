## Mathematical Models & Calculations

**Moving Average Methods:**
- Simple MA: F(t+1) = (A(t) + A(t-1) + ... + A(t-n+1)) / n
- Weighted MA: F(t+1) = Σ(wi × A(t-i+1)) where Σwi = 1
- Exponential MA: F(t+1) = α × A(t) + (1-α) × F(t)

**Exponential Smoothing Models:**
- Single: F(t+1) = α × A(t) + (1-α) × F(t)
- Holt (Double): F(t+1) = (L(t) + T(t)) where L(t) = α × A(t) + (1-α) × (L(t-1) + T(t-1))
- Winters (Triple): F(t+1) = (L(t) + T(t)) × S(t+1-m) with seasonal component

**ARIMA Framework:**
- ARIMA(p,d,q): ∇^d Y(t) = φ1∇^d Y(t-1) + ... + φp∇^d Y(t-p) + θ1ε(t-1) + ... + θqε(t-q) + ε(t)
- Box-Jenkins methodology: Identification → Estimation → Diagnostic checking
- Seasonal ARIMA: SARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)s for seasonal patterns

**Regression Models:**
- Linear: Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + ... + βkXk + ε
- Multiple R²: R² = 1 - (SSE/SST) where SSE = Σ(Yi - Ŷi)²
- Adjusted R²: R²adj = 1 - [(1-R²)(n-1)/(n-k-1)]

## Forecast Accuracy Measurement

**Error Metrics:**
- Mean Absolute Deviation: MAD = Σ|A(t) - F(t)|/n
- Mean Squared Error: MSE = Σ(A(t) - F(t))²/n
- Root Mean Squared Error: RMSE = √MSE
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error: MAPE = (100/n) × Σ|A(t) - F(t)|/A(t)

**Tracking Signals:**
- Tracking Signal = RSFE/MAD where RSFE = Running Sum of Forecast Errors
- Control limits: ±4 to ±8 MADs for statistical control
