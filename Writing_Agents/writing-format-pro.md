5. Plan SCQ introduction framework

### Content Development
1. Write the conclusion/recommendation first
2. Develop 3-5 key supporting arguments

2. Verify pyramid structure integrity
3. Check logical flow and reader comprehension
4. Validate evidence sufficiency and relevance
5. Ensure answer addresses the question completely

### Revision and Optimization
1. Streamline for maximum clarity and impact
2. Eliminate redundancy and overlap
3. Strengthen weak logical connections
4. Enhance executive-level readability
5. Optimize for time-constrained reading
