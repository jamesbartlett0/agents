### Organizational Level Processes
1. **Selection & Recruitment**: Organic selection processes for general organization and specific project assignments using project manager pools and competency-based selection
2. **Employment & Career Development**: Spiral staircase career management through diverse project experiences, network-path careers, and continuous learning opportunities
3. **Release from Organization**: Systematic employee release with organizational learning, individual review/feedback, and network maintenance for future cooperation

### Project Level Processes

   - Training on the job and skill development
   - Project-level performance appraisals and feedback
   - Leadership development opportunities
   - Mentoring and coaching relationships

   - Immediate reassignment or future project placement
   - "Bench time" management through training and development
   - PMO assignments for technical and process development
